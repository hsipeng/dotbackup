Fix time differences between Ubuntu and Windows


A. 

For Ubuntu 16.04 and newer, run the following command (thanks to Erwinson Pagtalunan for the update!):

timedatectl set-local-rtc 1


You can then check if Ubuntu uses local time, you can then use the following command:
timedatectl



sudo sed -i 's/UTC=yes/UTC=no/' /etc/default/rcS


And then reboot.


B. To fix this from Windows (it should work with Vista SP2, Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 and Windows 8/8.1)

Then, to disable the Windows Time service н╦лл WindowsTimeFixUTC.reg

sc config w32time start= disabled

And reboot.




How to revert the changes


A. From Ubuntu:

Ubuntu 16.04 and newer: to revert the changes, simply run the following command:
timedatectl set-local-rtc 0

Ubuntu versions older than 16.04: all you have to do is replace "UTC=no" with "UTC=yes" in the /etc/default/rcS file. To do this automatically, copy/paste the command below in a terminal:

sudo sed -i 's/UTC=no/UTC=yes/' /etc/default/rcS

And then reboot your computer.


B. From Windows: reverting this change is a bit more complicated from Windows. 

Firstly, open the .reg file downloaded when applying the fix for Windows (see download link above) with a text editor and change the "RealTimeIsUniversal" value from "dword:00000001" to "-" (without the quotes). Here's how the file should look like after making this change:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation]
"RealTimeIsUniversal"=-


Then save the file and double click it. 

Next, run the following command in Command Prompt (which you need to run as Administrator) to re-enable the Windows Time service:
sc config w32time start= demand
And finally, reboot.
